    <h1>Smartphones Becoming More Addicting?</h1>

    <div id="main">

        <h2>Daily Use of Smartphones</h2>

        <p>Everyday phones are being used to do daily activities, which included talking to another person via text messaging, social media(Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, i.e.), music, taking pictures as well as videos.
            The Smartphone does it all, and people use them non-stop... Today's teens spend more than 7 1/2 hours a day consuming media- watching TV, listening to music, surfing the Web, social networking, and playing video games, according to a 2010 study of 8 - to 18-year-olds
            conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p>

                This graph shows the relationship between the age of a person and the times when a person looks at their phone minutely and hourly. As the age rises the percentages of a person using their phone minutely and hourly
                decreases because of the age their getting older and what seems like the elders don't use their smart phones as often as teens do. So we see more teens using their phones more often and because of this, teens know more about the latest fashion, sports, video games, music, and more. Most likely because they are on their phones constantly updating their news feeds and
                seeing everything new at every hour of a day.

                The pie chart represents the percentage of people and how they feel when they lose their phone, which is very sad how this is told to us. So many people feel panicked when they lose there phone since they are so attached to it.
            I understand that your phone is important in communicating between someone instantaneously, but sometimes it is a good thing that you lost it. It makes you feel better now that you can just relax and do anything without worrying about
            any social media drama. Having lost your phone, think about it in a good way and how it can help you be relieved of worries of social media. The percentage of people who are feel sick when they lose their phone I think have to change the way they use their phone, if you
            are feeling sick when you lose your phone, you are way to connected to your phone to become sick when you lose it. It is well important to leave your phone down and disconnect it for periods of time, haveing the feeling of that you can not leave your phones
            side is very dangerous at point, by always needing it no matter what.
