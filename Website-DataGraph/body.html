                <h2>Daily Use of Smartphones</h2>

                    <p>Everyday phones are being used to do daily activities, which included talking to another person via text messaging, social media(Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter, i.e.), music, taking pictures as well as videos.
                    The Smartphone does it all, and people use them non-stop... Today’s teens spend more than 7 1/2 hours a day consuming media — watching TV, listening to music, surfing the Web, social networking, and playing video games, according to a 2010 study of 8 - to 18-year-olds
                    conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. </p>

                    <p>This graph shows the relationship between the age of a person and the times when a person looks at their phone minutely and hourly. As the age rises the percentages of a person using their phone minutely and hourly
                    decreases because of the age their getting older and what seems like the elders don't use their smartphones as often as teens do. So we see more teens using their phones more often and because of this, teens know more about the latest fashion, sports, video games, music, and more. Most likely because they are on their phones constantly updating their news feeds and
                    seeing everything new at every hour of a day.
